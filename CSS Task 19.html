        <ul>
            <li>Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that have lived on Earth for about 245 million years.</li>
            <li>In 1842, the English naturalist Sir Richard Owen coined the term Dinosauria, derived from the Greek deinos, meaning “fearfully great,” and sauros, meaning “lizard.”</li>
            <li>Dinosaur fossils have been found on all seven continents.</li>
            <li>All non-avian dinosaurs went extinct about 66 million years ago.</li>
            <li>There are roughly 700 known species of extinct dinosaurs.</li>
            <li>Modern birds are a kind of dinosaur because they share a common ancestor with non-avian dinosaurs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Paleontologists are like detectives who examine the evidence that extinct animals left behind. Those clues to what dinosaurs were like are found in fossils—the ancient remains of an organism, such as teeth, bone, or shell—or evidence of animal activity, such as footprints and trackways.</p>

            <p>Everything we know about non-avian dinosaurs is based on fossils, which include bones, teeth, footprints, tracks, eggs, and skin impressions. For centuries, people throughout the world have discovered amazing fossilized bones and footprints. Early finds inspired legends and fairy tales, as people imagined that these bones belonged to giants or huge monsters.</p></div>
