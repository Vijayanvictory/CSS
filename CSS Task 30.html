    <p>Employees are the blood of any organisation. A body is live until the blood is flowing freely inside it. Similarly an organisation is successful until its employees are given freedom to complete any given task their way. The organisation should instruct its employees to do the work and should not have interest on how to do the work. If it interferes in working lives of its employees extensively, then the organisation is definitely creating obstacles in smooth blood flowing inside its soul.
