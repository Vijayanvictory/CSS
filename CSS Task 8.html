    <p class="x1">Mental toughness is a measure of individual resilience and confidence that may predict success in sport, education, and the workplace.[1] The concept emerged in the context of sports training, as one of a set of attributes that allow a person to become a better athlete and able to cope with difficult training and difficult competitive situations and emerge without losing confidence. The term has been used by coaches, sport psychologists, sports commentators, and business leaders.</p>
    <p class="x2">Mental toughness and positivity are essential for someone to be successful. Whether in sports or in the workplace, an individual cannot fold under pressure if they want to thrive. When times get hard they have to stay positive and believe that, if they work hard enough, the outcome they desire will occur. This especially applies to athletes; when times get tough they have to keep grinding and do everything in their power to come back and win. An elite athlete must be able to handle pressure, have self-confidence, and avoid lifestyle distractions[jargon]. Mental toughness is easiest to learn as a child or during adolescence. The sooner one learns how to be mentally tough, the easier sports and life will become. Mental toughness is widely useful.[2][3]</p>
